<i>Battery Charge Limiter</i> (BCL) is a fork of <b>Battery Charge Limit</b> whose development has been stalled for some time.

<i>This app is a work in progress. If a feature is not working, do not hesitate to file a report.</i>

<b>Features:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Free and open source.</li>
    <li>Material 3 with dynamic colours.</li>
    <li>Control when to start and stop charging â€” either directly or via an widget.</li>
    <li>Set voltage threshold.</li>
    <li>Set custom battery control configuration if the supplied ones cannot be used properly.</li>
</ul>

<b>Same as ACC?</b>

ACC offers a broad range of features which might be too much for some people.

<b>Troubleshooting</b>

If BCL cannot start or stop charging correctly, enable <b>Always Write CTRL File</b> in the settings.
